Timetabling and Payroll system for a retail

30/10/2024
This system was created via MERN stack. At the minute it allows the user to: create new roles, create shifts, view shifts, and view a weekly payslip. I have started working on authentication but I'm at the minute taking a break from this project to focus on my studies.

In the future this system will allow Managers to create new employee accounts with the ability to verify emails. Components related to creating payslips and roles will be limited to accounts with the correct authorisation (managers) meanwhile employees will only be able to see their payslips and hours on the rota.
